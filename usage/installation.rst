Installing Goost
================

Prerequisites
-------------

Compiling Godot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only way to start using Goost is by compiling the Godot Engine from source,
please follow the Godot Engine official documentation instructions for your 
target platform of interest if you're not familiar with the build process:

- :ref:`Compiling Godot Engine<toc-devel-compiling>`

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Goost aims to target both Godot Engine's stable and development versions. For
the current version this documentation targets, you'll need to checkout the
respective Godot branch:

.. parsed-literal::
    cd godot
    git checkout |godot_branch|


If you ever need to compile Goost for other versions, the compatibility table
can be summarized as following:

+----------------------+---------------------+
|     Goost branch     |    Godot branch     |
+======================+=====================+
| ``gd3`` (latest)     | ``3.2`` (stable)    |
+----------------------+---------------------+
| ``1.0-gd3`` (stable) | ``3.2`` (stable)    |
+----------------------+---------------------+
| ``gd4`` (latest)     | ``master`` (latest) |
+----------------------+---------------------+

.. note::
    The default Goost branch always targets the latest Godot *stable* version. 

Compiling Goost
---------------

Getting the source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most straightforward way to get the source is by cloning the
`Goost repository <https://github.com/goostengine/goost>`_:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/goostengine/goost

Building
~~~~~~~~

Goost is implemented as a regular C++ module, so please refer to official 
Godot Engine documentation on how to compile the engine with custom modules:

- :ref:`Introduction to the build system: Custom modules <doc_buildsystem_custom_modules>`
- :ref:`Custom modules in C++ <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>`

The recommended way to compile Goost is by using the ``custom_modules`` build
option:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd godot
    scons custom_modules="/path/to/directory/containing/goost"

If you have both Goost and Godot sources within the same current directory, the
above can be simplified to:

.. code-block:: shell

    scons -C godot custom_modules=".."

The resulting executable should be available under the ``bin/`` directory within
Godot's source tree once the build process is done.

Run the executable and search the built-in documentation pages to make sure that
the classes provided by the extension are instantly accessible (as seen in the
:ref:`Class reference <toc-class-ref>`).

.. tip::
    You can use ``extra_suffix`` build option if you want to distinguish between
    vanilla Godot binaries and Godot with the Goost extension:
    
    .. code-block:: shell

        scons custom_modules=".." extra_suffix="goost"

.. note:: 
    Please `report any issues <https://github.com/goostengine/goost/issues/new/choose>`_ 
    if you stumble upon compilation errors.
